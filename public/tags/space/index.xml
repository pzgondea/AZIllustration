      <description>LOVE GROWS AND GROWS Love Grows and Grows: A Blooming Story for an Extended Family illustrates a healthy, collaborative approach to co-parenting. Styled as human-hybrid flowers, the characters themselves are a metaphor for growth and the evolution toward love.
The story follows young siblings Flora and Leaf as they transition into a new and unfamiliar life between two homes-one with Mom, and one with Dad and his new wife. Their journey highlights the challenges associated with creating extended families: a child&amp;rsquo;s apprehension of meeting someone new, and eventually choosing to accept and embrace this person as a part of their secular family.</description>
